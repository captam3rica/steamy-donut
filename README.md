Easily install packaged apps without installing over a newer version. Download and install software that is available directly from the internet. (Examples: Google Chrome Browser, FireFox, Microsoft Office Suite)

This project will start with installing local `.pkg` installers, but will grow to handle `.dmg` bundled installers, direct internet downloads, and other methods of installing macOS apps.

## Usage

```
usage: steamydonut.zsh [-h] --app-name <"app_name"> --app-version <version> --pkg-name <"package_name"> [--path <full_path>] [--list-donuts] [--get-donut <keyword>] [--version]

                      sure to it in double quotes ("").
